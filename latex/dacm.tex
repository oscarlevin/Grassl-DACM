\chapter[{A Brief History of Fibonacci Numbers}]{A Brief History of Fibonacci Numbers}\label{ch_fibs}
Fibonacci numbers receive their name from Leonardo of Pisa (Leonardo Pisano, c. 1175-1250), better known as Leonardo Fibonacci. Fibonacci is a contraction of Filius Bonacci, son of Bonacci%
\par
Leonardo was born about 1175 in the commercial center of Pisa. This was a time of great interest and importance in the history of Western Civilization. One finds the influence of the crusades stirring and awakening the people of Europe by bringing them in contact with the more advanced intellect of the East. During this time the Universities of Naples, Padua, Paris, Oxford, and Cambridge were established, the Magna Carta signed in England, and the long struggle between the Papacy and the Empire was culminated. Commerce was flourishing in the Mediterranean world and adventurous travelers such as Marco Polo were penetrating far beyond the borders of the known world%
\par
It is in this growing commercial activity that we find the young Leonardo at Bugia on the Northern coast of Africa. Here the merchants of Pisa and other commercial cities of Italy had large warehouses for the storage of their goods. Actually very little is known about the life of this great mathematician. No contemporary historian makes mention of him, and one must look to his writings to find information about him%
\par
A mathematician before his time, Leonardo of Pisa, alias Leonardo Pisano, alias Leonardo Bigollo, alias Fibonacci, was a despair to his teacher as a young boy and an enigma to his colleagues in his later years. Convinced of the superiority of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system over the Roman system, Leonardo wrote one of his greatest works, \emph{Liber Abaci} (in English, ``Book of Calculating'') to introduce this system to the Western world. The \emph{Liber Abaci} was written in 1202 but was not published until 1857 because ``it was too advanced for Leonardo's contemporaries.'' Along with the introduction and development of many mathematical topics, the \emph{Liber Abaci} contained interesting story problems that Leonardo liked to invent. His most popular problem is the breeding pair of rabbits: ``How many pairs of rabbits will there be after a year if it is assumed that every month each pair produces one new pair, which begins to bear young two months after its own birth?''%
\par
This problem generates the infinite sequence that bears his name because his work is the earliest known recording. The Fibonacci sequence begins with 1 and each number that follows is the sum of the previous two numbers. The first ten Fibonnaci numbers are: \(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,
34, 55\).%
\par
Leonardo, in 1228, gave a second edition of the \emph{Liber Abaci} which he dedicated to Michel Scott, astrologer to the Emperor Frederic II and author of many scientific works. Copies of this edition exist today. Leonardo profusely illustrated and strongly advocated the Hindu-Arabic system in this work. He gave an extensive discussion of the Rule of False Position and the Rule of Three. Leonardo did not use a general method in problem solving; each problem was solved independently of the others. In the solution of a problem he not only considered the problem as it might occur, but considered all of the variations of the question, even those that were not reasonable%
\par
Because of Leonardo's great reputation, the emperor Frederick II, when in Pisa (1225), held a sort of mathematical tournament to test Leonardo's skill. The competitors were informed beforehand of the questions to be asked, some or all of which were composed by Johannes of Palermo, who was of Frederick's staff. This is the first case in the history of mathematics that one meets with an instance of these challenges to solve particular problems which were so common in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries%
\par
The first question propounded was to find a number of which the square when decreased or increased by 5 would remain a square. The correct answer given by Leonardo was 41/12. The next question was to find by the methods used in the tenth book of Euclid a line whose length x should satisfy the equation \(x^3 + 2x^2 + 10x - 20 = 0\) . Leonardo showed by geometry that the problem was impossible, but he gave an approximation of the root \(1.3688081075\ldots\), which is correct to nine places. \emph{Liber Abaci} contains many additional problems of this type%
\par
After the ``Rabbit Problem,'' the matter lay for 400 years. In 1611, Johann Kepler, of astronomy fame, arrived at the series \(1, 1, 2, 3, 5,
8, 13, 21, \ldots\) . There is no indication that he had access to one of Fibonacci's hand-written books (the \emph{Liber Abaci} was not published until 1857).%
\par
Simon Stevens (1548-1620) wrote on the famous Golden Section.  The editor of his works, A. Gerarad, arrived at the following formula for expressing the series in 1634:%
\begin{equation*}
F_{n + 2} = F_{n + 1} + F_{n}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
A hundred years must pass before the problem is again considered. In 1753, R. Simpson derived a formula, implied by Kepler:%
\begin{equation*}
F_{n - 1}F_{n + 1} - F_{n}^{2} = \left( - 1 \right)^{n}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
A second hundred years pass by and the series again comes under study. In 1843, J.P.M. Binet derives an analytical function for determining the value of any Fibonacci number:%
\begin{equation*}
2^n \sqrt{5} F^n = (1 + \sqrt{5})^{n} - (1 - \sqrt{5})^{n}.
\end{equation*}
In 1846 E. Catalan derived the formula:%
\begin{equation*}
2^{n - 1}F_{n} = \frac{n}{1} + \frac{5n\left( n - 1 \right)\left( n - 2 \right)}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3} + \frac{5^{2}n\left( n - 1 \right)\left( n - 2 \right)\left( n - 3 \right)\left( n - 4 \right)}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
By now, the series had received enough attention to deserve a name. It was variously called the Braun series, the Schimper-Braun series, the Lamé series and the Gerhardt series. A. Braun, applied the series to the arrangement of the scales of pine cones. Schimper is completely unknown. Gerhardt is probably a misspelling of Girard%
\par
Edouard Lucas, who dominated the field of recursive series during the period 1876-1891, first applied Fibonacci's name to the series and it has been known as the Fibonacci series since then%
\par
About this time, 1858, Sam Loyd claimed to have invented the checkerboard paradox. It is first found in print in a German journal in 1868. Today it seems proper to call it the Carroll Paradox after Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson, 1832-1893) who was quite fond of it.%

\par
The sequence of Catalan numbers, named after Eugene Catalan who along with Euler discovered many of the properties of these numbers, is \(1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, \ldots\). The characterizations below show that a formula for these numbers is given by%
\begin{equation*}
C_{n + 1} = C_{1}C_{n} + C_{2}C_{n - 1} + \ldots + C_{n}C_{1}
\end{equation*}
with \(C_1 = 1\), \(C_2 = 1\), etc.%

In how many ways can you insert parentheses in the nonassociative product \(abcd\)? The five ways are displayed%
\begin{equation*}
(ab)(cd)\quad ((ab)c)d \quad a(b(cd)) \quad (a(bc))d \quad a((bc)d).
\end{equation*}
%
\par
There are two ways for \(abc\), namely \(a(bc)\) and \((ab)c\), and one for \(ab\). For a product of \(n\) symbols \(a_{1}a_{2}\ldots a_{n}\), break it at the \(k\)th symbol:%
\begin{equation*}
(a_{1}a_{2}a_{3}\ldots a_{k})(a_{k + 1}\ldots a_{n}).
\end{equation*}
Let \(P_{n}\) denote the number of ways of inserting parentheses into this product. There are \(P_k\) ways of inserting parentheses in \(\left(a_{1}\ldots a_{k} \right)\) and \(P_{n - k}\) ways for the factor \((a_{k + 1}\ldots a_{n})\) . Letting \(k\) range from 1 to \(n - 1\) we have that%
\begin{equation*}
P_{n} = \sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} P_{k}P_{n - k} = P_{1}P_{n - 1} + P_{2}P_{n - 2} + \ldots + P_{n - 1}P_{1}.

\(2n\) people stand in line at a theatre. Admission is 50 cents, (denoted by H), and the box office starts with no change. \(n\) of the people have H and \(n\) have \textdollar{}1 (denoted D). In how many ways can the \(2n\) people line up so that all can be admitted? Here we enumerate the number of workable sequences of n H's and n D's such that at each point in the sequence the number of H's is not less than the number of D's%
\par
The total number of sequences of \(n\) H's and \(n\) D's is \(\binom{2n}{n}\). We delete the number of \emph{nonworkable} sequences. Each such sequence has a first snag as shown by the highlighted D in%
\begin{equation*}
\text{H\ H\ D\ D\ \alert{D}\ H\ H\ D\ D\ D\ H\ H}
\end{equation*}
Reverse each letter up to and including the snag, obtaining%
\begin{equation*}
\text{D D H H H H H D D D H H},
\end{equation*}
a sequence of \(n+1\) H's and \(n-1\) D's. For \(n = 3\) , H D \alert{D} D H H is a nonworkable sequence with the snag indicated. Its mate, found by reversing the first three letters, is D H H D H H, a sequence of 2D's and 4H's. \emph{Any} arrangement of 2D's and 4H's will correspond to exactly one nonworkable sequence; simply scan through and see the \emph{first} time the H's dominate the D's and then reverse through that spot. There are \(\binom{6}{3}
= 20\) arrangements of 3H's and 3D's. There are \(\binom{6}{2}
= 15\) arrangements of 2D's and 4H's each of which corresponds to a nonworkable sequence. Hence there are \(\binom{6}{3}
-\binom{6}{2} = 5\) workable sequences. In general, \(\binom{2n}{n}  - \binom{2n}{n - 1} = \frac{1}{n + 1}\binom{2n}{n}\) gives the number of workable sequences. See \hyperref[catalaninpascal]{Figure~\ref{catalaninpascal}}%
\par
For \(n=3\), the matching of the 5 workable sequences with one of the 5 ways of parenthesizing, given by the bijection which sends an H to a left parenthesis and a D to a letter, is presented below.%
%
\begin{gather*}
\text{H H H D D D} \leftrightarrow  (((abcd \\
\text{H H D H D D} \leftrightarrow  ((a(bcd \\
\text{H H D D H D} \leftrightarrow  ((ab(cd \\
\text{H D H H D D} \leftrightarrow  (a((bcd \\

One such path to \((3, 3)\) is shown in \hyperref[catalanpathex]{Figure~\ref{catalanpathex}}.%

\hypertarget{exercisegroup-1}{}\par\noindent For each of the following, investigate bijections that relate one to another.%
\begin{exercisegroup}(1)
\exercise[13.]\hypertarget{exercise-36}{}A and B each receive \(n\) votes. Let \(V_{n}\) denote the number of ways that the \(2n\) votes can be tallied so that A never trails B. Let \(V_{0} = 1\).%
\exercise[14.]\hypertarget{exercise-37}{}Place \(2n\) points on the circumference of a circle and draw \(n\)  nonintersecting chords in \(D_{n}\) ways; \(D_{0} = 1\)%
\exercise[15.]\hypertarget{exercise-38}{}In how many ways can \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2n\) be inserted into a \(2\times n\) rectangle such that the entries are increasing in rows and columns.  Let the answer be \(Y_n\); \(Y_1 = 1\), \(Y_2 = 2\).%
\exercise[16.]\hypertarget{exercise-39}{}Place \(2n\) points on a line segment and join them in pairs by nonintersecting arcs above the segment. In how many ways can this be done? Call the answer \(S_{n}\); \(S_{1}=1\), \(S_{2}=2\).%
\exercise[17.]\hypertarget{exercise-40}{}A rook on an \(n + 1\) by \(n + 1\) chessboard must move from the lower left corner to the upper right corner never going above the diagonal. How many paths are possible? Let \(K_{n}\) be the answer.%
\exercise[18.]\hypertarget{exercise-41}{}On an \(n + 1\) by \(n + 1\) chessboard a king starts on the first row and moves one square forward or back along a fixed column and ends on the starting square after \(2n\) moves. In how many ways, \(G_{n}\) , can this be done?%
\exercise[19.]\hypertarget{exercise-42}{}Count the number of planar rhyme schemes for a stanza consisting of \(n\) lines. Joanne Growney showed in her doctoral thesis that the Bell numbers, which count all rhyme schemes, have the Catalan numbers as a subsequence and that these enumerate precisely the planar rhyme schemes. For example, of the \(B_4 = 15\) rhyme schemes, \(C_4 = 14\) are planar. The nonplanar one is given by \(abab\).%

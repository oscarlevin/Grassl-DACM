A BRIEF HISTORY OF FIBONACCI NUMBERS

Fibonacci numbers receive their name from Leonardo of Pisa (Leonardo
Pisano, c. 1175-1250), better known as Leonardo Fibonacci. Fibonacci is
a contraction of Filius Bonacci, son of Bonacci
</p>

<p>
  Leonardo was born about 1175 in the commercial center of Pisa. This was
  a time of great interest and importance in the history of Western
  Civilization. One finds the influence of the crusades stirring and
  awakening the people of Europe by bringing them in contact with the more
  advanced intellect of the East. During this time the Universities of
  Naples, Padua, Paris, Oxford, and Cambridge were established, the Magna
  Carta signed in England, and the long struggle between the Papacy and
  the Empire was culminated. Commerce was flourishing in the Mediterranean
  world and adventurous travelers such as Marco Polo were penetrating far
  beyond the borders of the known world
</p>

<p>
  It is in this growing commercial activity that we find the young
  Leonardo at Bugia on the Northern coast of Africa. Here the merchants of
  Pisa and other commercial cities of Italy had large warehouses for the
  storage of their goods. Actually very little is known about the life of
  this great mathematician. No contemporary historian makes mention of
  him, and one must look to his writings to find information about him
</p>

<p>
  A mathematician before his time, Leonardo of Pisa, alias Leonardo
  Pisano, alias Leonardo Bigollo, alias Fibonacci, was a despair to his
  teacher as a young boy and an enigma to his colleagues in his later
  years. Convinced of the superiority of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system
  over the Roman system, Leonardo wrote one of his greatest works,
  <em>Liber Abaci</em> (in English, <q>Book of Calculating</q>) to introduce
  this system to the Western world. The <em>Liber Abaci</em> was written in
  1202 but was not published until 1857 because ``it was too advanced for
  Leonardo's contemporaries''. Along with the introduction and development
  of many mathematical topics, the <em>Liber Abaci</em> contained
  interesting story problems that Leonardo liked to invent. His most
  popular problem is the breeding pair of rabbits: ``How many pairs of
  rabbits will there be after a year if it is assumed that every month
  each pair produces one new pair, which begins to bear young two months
  after its own birth?''

  This problem generates the infinite sequence that bears his name because
  his work is the earliest known recording. The Fibonacci sequence begins
  with 1 and each number that follows is the sum of the previous two
  numbers. The first ten Fibonnaci numbers are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,
  34, 55
</p>

<p>
  Leonardo, in 1228, gave a second edition of the <em>Liber Abaci</em> which
  he dedicated to Michel Scott, astrologer to the Emperor Frederic II and
  author of many scientific works. Copies of this edition exist today.
  Leonardo profusely illustrated and strongly advocated the Hindu-Arabic
  system in this work. He gave an extensive discussion of the Rule of
  False Position and the Rule of Three. Leonardo did not use a general
  method in problem solving; each problem was solved independently of the
  others. In the solution of a problem he not only considered the problem
  as it might occur, but considered all of the variations of the question,
  even those that were not reasonable
</p>

<p>
  Because of Leonardo's great reputation, the emperor Frederick II, when
  in Pisa (1225), held a sort of mathematical tournament to test
  Leonardo's skill. The competitors were informed beforehand of the
  questions to be asked, some or all of which were composed by Johannes of
  Palermo, who was of Frederick's staff. This is the first case in the
  history of mathematics that one meets with an instance of these
  challenges to solve particular problems which were so common in the
  sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
</p>

<p>
  The first question propounded was to find a number of which the square
  when decreased or increased by 5 would remain a square. The correct
  answer given by Leonardo was 41/12. The next question was to find by the
  methods used in the tenth book of Euclid a line whose length x should
  satisfy the equation <m>x^3 + 2x^2 + 10x - 20 = 0</m> . Leonardo showed by
  geometry that the problem was impossible, but he gave an approximation
  of the root 1.3688081075\ldots{}, which is correct to nine places.
  <em>Liber Abaci</em> contains many additional problems of this type
</p>

<p>
  After the `Rabbit Problem', the matter lay for 400 years. In 1611,
  Johann Kepler, of astronomy fame, arrived at the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,
  8, 13, 21, \ldots{} . There is no indication that he had access to one
  of Fibonacci's hand-written books (The <em>Liber Abaci</em> was not
  published until 1857).
  <md>
    _{n + 2} = F_{n + 1} + F_{n}
  </md>
  A hundred years must pass before the problem is again considered. In
  1753, R. Simpson derived a formula, implied by Kepler
  <md>
    _{n - 1}F_{n + 1} - F_{n}^{2} = \left( - 1 \right)^{n}
  </md>
  A second hundred years pass by and the series again comes under study.
  In 1843, J.P.M. Binet derives an analytical function for determining the
  value of any Fibonacci number

  2\textsuperscript{n} <m>\sqrt{5}</m> F\textsubscript{n} = (1
  + <m>\sqrt{5}</m> )\textsuperscript{n} - (1 - <m>\sqrt{5}</m> )\textsuperscript{n}

  In 1846 E. Catalan derived the formula:
  <md>
    ^{n - 1}F_{n} = \frac{n}{1} + \frac{5n\left( n - 1 \right)\left( n - 2 \right)}{1 \bullet 2 \bullet 3} + \frac{5^{2}n\left( n - 1 \right)\left( n - 2 \right)\left( n - 3 \right)\left( n - 4 \right)}{1 \bullet 2 \bullet 3 \bullet 4 \bullet 5}
  </md>
  By now, the series had received enough attention to deserve a name. It
  was variously called the Braun series, the Schimper-Braun series, the
  Lam√© series and the Gerhardt series. A. Braun, applied the series to the
  arrangement of the scales of pine cones. Schimper is completely unknown.
  Gerhardt is probably a misspelling of Girard
</p>

<p>
  Edouard Lucas, who dominated the field of recursive series during the
  period 1876-1891, first applied Fibonacci's name to the series and it
  has been known as the Fibonacci series since then
</p>

<p>
  About this time, 1858, Sam Loyd claimed to have invented the
  checkerboard paradox. It is first found in print in a German journal in
  1868. Today it seems proper to call it the Carroll Paradox after Lewis
  Carroll (Charles Dodgson, 1832-1893) who was quite fond of it.

      <title>Parenthesizing:</title>
      In how many ways can you insert parentheses
      in the nonassociative product abcd? The five ways are displayed

      (ab)(cd) ((ab)c)d a(b(cd)) (a(bc))d a((bc)d)

      There are two ways for abc, namely a(bc) and (ab)c, and one for (ab).
      For a product of n symbols
      a\textsubscript{1}a\textsubscript{2}\ldots{}a\textsubscript{n}, break
      it at the k-th symbol:</li>
  </ol>
  <md>
    \left( a_{1}a_{2}a_{3}\ldots a_{k} \right)(a_{k + 1}\ldots a_{n})
  </md>
  Let P\textsubscript{n} denote the number of ways of inserting integers
  into this product. There are P\textsubscript{k} ways of inserting
  parentheses in <m>\left( a_{1}\ldots a_{k} \right)</m> and <m>P_{n - k}</m> ways for the factor <m>(a_{k + 1}\ldots a_{n})</m> . Letting k range from 1
  to <m>n - 1</m> we have that
  <md>
    _{n} = \sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1}{P_{k}P_{n - k} = P_{1}P_{n - 1} + P_{2}P_{n - 2} + \ldots + P_{n - 1}P_{1}}
  </md>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <title>The H-D sequences:</title>
      2n people stand in line at a theatre.
      Admission is 50 cents, (denoted by H), and the box office starts with no
      change. n of the people have H and n have \$1(D). In how many ways can
      the 2n people line up so that all can be admitted? Here we enumerate
      the number of workable sequences of n H's and n D's such that at each
      point in the sequence the number of H's is not less than the number of
      D's
    </p>

    <p>
      The total number of sequences of n H's and n D's is <m>\left( \frac{2n}{n} \right)</m> . We delete the number of
      \textbf{nonworkable} sequences. Each such sequence has a first snag as
      shown by the arrow in

      H H D D D H H D D D H H

      Reverse each letter up to and including the snag, obtaining

      D D H H H H H D D D H H

      a sequence of n+1 H's and <m>n - 1</m> D's. For <m>n = 3</m> , H D D D H H is
      a nonworkable sequence with the snag indicated. Its mate, found by
      reversing the first three letters, is

      D H H D H H, a sequence of 2D's and 4H's. <em>Any</em> arrangement of
      2D's and 4H's will correspond to exactly one nonworkable sequence;
      simply scan through and see the <em>first</em> time the H's dominate the
      D's and then reverse through that spot. There are <m>\binom{6}{3}
      = 20</m> arrangements of 3H's and 3D's. There are <m>\binom{6}{2}
      = 15</m> arrangements of 2D's and 4H's each of which
      corresponds to a nonworkable sequence. Hence there are <m>\binom{6}{3}
      -\binom{6}{2}
      = 5</m> workable sequences. In general, <m>\left( \frac{2n}{n} \right) - \left( \frac{2n}{n - 1} \right) = \frac{1}{n + 1}\left( \frac{2n}{n} \right)</m> gives the number of workable sequences. See FIGURE 1

  The last pattern indicates that no line rhymes with any other. The
  Catalan numbers seem to be popping up again. For <em>n</em> = 4 there
  happen to be 15 (not 14) patterns:
  \begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccccccccccccccc@{}}

  \bottomrule

  \end{longtable}

  One of these, abab, is special in that it is the only <q>non-planar</q>
  scheme. In this pattern, you cannot connect the a's with an arc and the
  b's with an arc without the arcs crossing
</p>

<p>
  The planar rhyme schemes are enumerated by the Catalan numbers. These
  numbers are a subsequence of the Bell numbers, which enumerate all rhyme
  schemes
</p>

<p>
Thus far, we have the following bijections:

Parentheses   H-D sequences

H-D   Paths

Triangulations   Parentheses

Insertions   Paths

Trees   Parentheses

See if you can connect the rhyme schemes to any of the above.

    STIRLING NUMBERS OF THE 2\textsuperscript{nd} KIND

    A distribution of 4 different (often we say distinguishable) objects <m>1,2,3,4</m> into 3 similar (often we say indistinguishable) boxes, each
    of which becomes non-empty is modeled by partitioning <m>\{ 1,2,3,4\}</m> into 3 nonempty subsets. The six ways of doing this are listed next:

    \{4\} \{1\} \{2,3\} \{1,4\} \{2\} \{3\}

    \{4\} \{2\} \{1,3\} \{1\} \{2,4\} \{3\}

    \{4\} \{3\} \{1,2\} \{1\} \{2\} \{3,4\}

    The Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted by <m>S(n,k)</m> , give the
    number of ways of partitioning an n-set into k non-empty subsets. Here <m>k \in \{ 1,2,\ldots\}</m> and <m>n \geq k</m> . The above example shows <m>S\left( 4,3 \right) = 6</m> . Also notice that there are two cases: 4 is
    alone, or 4 is in some other batch; we can conclude that <m>S\left( 4,3 \right) = 3S\left( 3,3 \right) + S(3,2)</m> since if 4 is in
    a singleton set just partition the remaining 3 into 2 sets and otherwise
    4 can join any of the 3 batches of 3 elements.

    THEOREM 1: <m>S\left( n,k \right) = kS\left( n - 1,k \right) + S(n - 1,k - 1)</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    Proof. We partition <m>\{ 1,2,\ldots,n\}</m> into k non-empty subsets in <m>S(n,k)</m> ways. If n is in a singleton set, there are <m>S(n - 1,k - 1)</m> ways to partition the remaining <m>n - 1</m> elements
    into <m>k - 1</m> subsets. Otherwise, the element n can join any of the k
    batches of <m>n - 1</m> elements in <m>kS(n - 1,k)</m> ways
  </p>

  <p>
    Polya, in Notes on Introductory Combinatorics, refers to these as the
    <q>antisocial'' and ``social</q> cases
  </p>

  <p>
    The reader should check that <m>S\left( 3,3 \right) = 1</m> and that <m>S\left( 3,2 \right) = 3</m> so that <m>S\left( 4,3 \right) = 3 \bullet 1 + 3 = 6</m> .

    <em>Border Formulas:} The reader should verify that <m>S\left( n,1 \right) = 1</m> and <m>S\left( n,n \right) = 1</m> for <m>n \in Z^{+</em></m> . From

    these border formulas and the recursion in Theorem 1 the following
    Stirling's Second Triangle can be made.

      <li><m>S\left( n,n - 3 \right) =\binom{n}{4}
        + 10\binom{n}{5}
        + 15\binom{n}{6}</m></li>
    </ol>
    Proof. You are asked to prove these in the problems
  </p>

  <p>
    The entries in the Pascal Triangle, <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> , satisfy the nice recursion <m>\binom{n}{k}
    =
    \binom{n - 1}{k}
    +\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}</m> and also have a closed formula: <m>\binom{n}{k}
    = n!/k!\left( n - k \right)!</m> . Theorem 1 gives us a
    recursion for the Stirling numbers <m>S\left( n,k \right)</m> and,
    unfortunately, the best we can do for a <q>closed</q> formula is contained
    in the following.
    <md>
      \left( n,k \right) = \frac{1}{k!}\left\lbrack k^{n} - \binom{k}{1} \left( k - 1 \right)^{n} + \binom{k}{2} \left( k - 2 \right)^{n} - \binom{k}{3} \left( k - 3 \right)^{n} + \ldots + \left( - 1 \right)^{k - 1}\binom{k}{k - 1} 1^{n} \right\rbrack
    </md>
    Proof (by Polya). Suppose you wished to paint n houses and you have k
    different colors available. The first house can be painted in k
    different ways, the second in k different ways, etc. So there are <m>k^{n}</m> ways. How many ways actually use all k colors? Let <m>\alpha_{i}</m> be the property that no house is painted with the <m>i^{th}</m> color, and let <m>N(\alpha_{i})</m> denote the number of ways of
    painting the n houses without using the <m>i^{th}</m> color. Analogously for <m>\text{N}\left( \alpha_{i},\alpha_{j} \right),N\left( \alpha_{i},\alpha_{j},\alpha_{k} \right),</m> etc. Since <m>N\left( \alpha_{i} \right) = \left( k - 1 \right)^{n}</m> , <m>N\left( a_{i},\alpha_{j} \right) = \left( k - 2 \right)^{n},\ldots</m> the number of ways of painting n houses using all k colors is, using
    PIE, <m>k^{n} -\binom{k}{1}
    \left( k - 1 \right)^{n} +
    \binom{k}{2}
    \left( k - 2 \right)^{n} -
    \binom{k}{3}
    \left( k - 3 \right)^{n} + \ldots + \left( - 1 \right)^{k}
    \binom{k}{k}
    0^{n}</m> . Alternately, we could first partition the n houses
    into k (non-empty) sets, and then paint each set. This can be
    accomplished in <m>k!S\left( n,k \right)</m> ways. Now equate these two
    expressions.

    COROLLARY. <m>S\left( n,3 \right) = \frac{1}{2}\left\lbrack 3^{n - 1} - 2^{n} + 1 \right\rbrack</m> THEOREM 4. <m>x^{n} = S\left( n,1 \right)x + S\left( n,2 \right)x\left( x - 1 \right) + S\left( n,3 \right)x\left( x - 1 \right)\left( x - 2 \right) + \ldots</m>
    <md>
      ldots + S\left( n,n \right)x\left( x - 1 \right)\ldots(x - n + 1)
    </md>
    Proof (by Polya). We can paint n houses, with x colors available, in <m>x^{n}</m> ways. Using exactly one color, there are <m>S\left( n,1 \right)x</m> ways. Using exactly two colors there are <m>S\left( n,2 \right)x(x - 1)</m> ways. Continue in this manner
  </p>

  <p>
    It is in this form that James Stirling originally developed these
    numbers. <m>S(n,k)</m> is used to convert from powers to binomial
    coefficients as shown in the following:

    generated by constructing what is called the Bell Triangle. To construct
    this triangle, begin with a 1 at the top and a 1 below it. Add these two
    numbers together and put the sum 2, to the right of the 1 in the second
    column. This 2 is also the first entry of the third row. The second
    entry in the third row is found by adding the 2 to the number 1 above
    it. This sum is 3 and goes to the right of the 2. The 3 is now below a
    2. Adding these two numbers produces the last number, 5, in the third
    row. Since 5 has no number above it, the third row is complete. 5 now
    becomes the first number in the fourth row and the process continues
  </p>

  <p>
    Construction of the triangle follows two basic rules:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The last number of each row is the first number of the next row.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>All other numbers are found by adding the number to the left of the
        missing number to the number directly above this same number.</li>
    </ol>
    When the triangle is extended, as above, the Bell Numbers are found down
    the first column as well as along the outside diagonal.

    52 67 87 114 151 203

    203 255 322 409 523 674 877

    As with Pascal's Triangle, the Bell triangle has several interesting
    properties. If the sum of a row is added to the Bell number at the end
    of that row, the next Bell number is obtained. For example, the sum of
    the fourth row plus the Bell number at the end of the row:

    15 + 20 + 27 + 37 + 52 + 52 is 203, the next Bell number. Also, the
    numbers of the second diagonal 1, 3, 10, 37, 151, 674, \ldots{} are the
    sums of the horizontal rows. Rotating the triangle slightly creates a
    difference triangle analogous to Pascal's Triangle. The entries that are
    formed recursively by adding in Pascal's Triangle are now differences of
    the two numbers above them in the Bell triangle.

    1 2 5 15 52 203 877\ldots{}

    1 3 10 37 151 674\ldots{}

    2 7 27 114 523\ldots{}

    5 20 87 409\ldots{}

    15 67 322\ldots{}

    52 255\ldots{}

    203\ldots{}

    Finally, rewriting the Bell triangle recursively indicates a nice
    connection of the Bell Numbers to Pascal's triangle. <m>B_{0} = B_{1}</m> <m>B_{1}</m> <m>B_{0} + B_{1} = B_{2}</m> <m>B_{2}</m> <m>B_{1} + B_{2}</m> <m>B_{0} + 2B_{1} + B_{2} = B_{3}</m> <m>B_{3}</m> <m>B_{2} + B_{3}</m> <m>B_{1} + B_{2} + B_{2} + B_{3}</m> <m>B_{0} + 3B_{1} + 3B_{2} + B_{3} = B_{4}</m> This pattern suggests the <m>{(n + 1)}^{\text{th}}</m> Bell Number can be
    represented recursively by <m>B_{n + 1} =
    \binom{n}{0}
    B_{0} +
    \binom{n}{1}
    B_{1} +
    \binom{n}{2}
    B_{2} + \ldots +
    \binom{n}{n}
    B_{n}</m> . The coefficients of this equation are the entries
    of the nth row of Pascal's triangle. You are asked to prove this
    recursion in the exercises
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bell numbers are related to the Stirling numbers and can be defined
    as the sum of the Stirling numbers of the second kind. That is, <m>B_{n} = S\left( n,1 \right) + S\left( n,2 \right) + \ldots + S(n,n)</m> ,
    where

    S(n, k) represents the number of ways of grouping n elements into k
    subsets. So <m>B_{3} = S\left( 3,1 \right) + S\left( 3,2 \right) + S\left( 3,3 \right) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5.</m> Since the Bell numbers count the partitions of a set of elements, they
    are used in prime-number theory to enumerate the number of ways to
    factor a number with distinct prime factors. For example, 42 has three
    distinct prime factors: 2, 3, and 7. Since <m>B_{3} = 5</m> , we know there
    are five ways of factoring 42. These are

    2 x 3 x 7, 2 x 21, 3 x 14, 6 x 7, and 42. So the number 210, which has 4
    distinct factors, 2, 3, 5, and 7, can be factored in <m>B_{4} = 15</m> ways
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bell numbers can be used to model many real-life situations. For
    example, the number of different ways two people can sleep in unlabeled
    twin beds is <m>B_{2} = 2</m> ways: They can sleep in the same bed or in
    separate beds. The number of ways of serving a dinner consisting of
    three items, such as a salad, bread, and fish is <m>B_{3} = 5</m> ways:
    each could be served on a separate plate, salad and bread could be on
    one plate and fish on another, salad and fish on one plate and bread on
    another, or all three items could be on the same plate. This example
    serves as a model for the five ways three people can occupy three
    unlabeled beds, the five ways three prisoners can be handcuffed
    together, the five ways three nations can be form alliances, or any
    situation of partitioning three distinct elements into non-empty
    subsets
  </p>

  <p>
    One interesting application of Bell numbers is in counting the number of
    rhyme schemes possible for a stanza in poetry. There are <m>B_{2} = 2</m> possibilities for a two-line stanza: the lines can either rhyme or not
    rhyme. The possible rhyme schemes of a three-line stanza can be
    described as aaa, aab, aba, abb, and abc: thus there are 5 or <m>B_{3}</m> possible rhyme schemes. The Japanese used diagrams depicting possible
    rhyme schemes of a five-line stanza <m>B_{5} = 52</m> as early as 1000
    A.D. in the <em>Tale of the Genji</em> by Lady Shikibu Murasaki.

    Tales of Statisticians

    ERIC TEMPLE BELL

    7 Feb 1883-20 Dec 1960

    Bell was no statistician; rather, a number theorist. He was and remains
    one of the great mathematical statesmen. His book \emph{Men of
    Mathematics} has inspired scores to take up a mathematical career, and
    revealed to uncounted thousands what a mathematical life is all about in
    the first place
  </p>

  <p>
    His own early life was a mystery until parts of it were unraveled by
    <em>Constance Reid</em> . He was born in Aberdeen in 1883, spent his early
    years in London, and came to America at the age of nineteen in 1903. He
    finished college at Stanford in 1904, and went on to the University of
    Washington (MS 1907) and Columbia (PhD 1912). He taught at the
    University of Washington from that year until1926. His contribution to
    statistics in this period was to encourage Harold Hotelling to switch
    from journalism to math (Hotelling named his son after Bell). In his own
    researches at this time, Bell produced significant results in number
    theory, including Diophantine analysis: equations whose solutions are
    limited to whole numbers. The Bell numbers (1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, and so
    on), a series of whole numbers arising in the theory of partitions, were
    first investigated by him, and are named for him. His 1921 memoir
    Arithmetical Paraphrases won him the prestigious Bocher Prize (jointly
    with Solomon Lefschetz) in 1924
  </p>

  <p>
    In that year he began a second life as a science fiction writer, under
    the pen name John Taine (his only son, born in 1917, had been named
    Taine Bell). In all, he produced twelve novels and several stories
    between 1924 and 1954. In 1926, having earlier declined offers from
    Chicago and Columbia, he joined the faculty of the California Institute
    of Technology, where he became a distinctive and even eccentric figure,
    and had much to do with building up the quality of the mathematics
    faculty. His next mathematical publication was the comprehensive survey
    Algebraic Arithmetic (1927). His enduring masterpiece of popularization,
    <em>Men of Mathematics</em> , came somewhat later, in 1937. The more
    technically advanced <em>Development of Mathematics</em> (1940) had a
    comparable appeal and influence for professional and preprofessional
    readers. His gift of explanation and his fascination with the integers
    are both evident in the <em>Magic of Numbers</em> (1946), a book on
    Pythagoras and the number mysticism of the Pythagorean school
  </p>

  <p>
    Bell retired from CalTech in 1951, and died at the age of 77 in 1960.
    With the assistance of D.H. Lehmer, who had provided the otherwise
    missing final chapter, he had just completed a book entitled The Last
    Problem. It was about Fermat, to whom, and to whose tantalizing unproven
    Last Theorem, a chapter of <em>Men of Mathematics</em> had already been
    devoted. Bell's conviction at the time, that Fermat's unmatched insight
    into the character of numbers did not mislead him as to the existence of
    a proof, was vindicated recently when a proof was finally found
  </p>

  <p>
    Bell's infectious love of number, his sense of the large sweep of
    mathematical history, and his generous anger at the barls and poopheads
    who all too densely populate that history, are his great legacy to
    posterity
  </p>

  <p>
    Postscript 2003

    The above notice happened to catch the eye of ETB's grandson, Lyle Bell,
    the only son of Taine Bell, who commented that ETB ``would have loved
    the last paragraph.'' We asked Lyle what ETB was like as a grandfather.
    Here, with his permission, is his answer, along with notes on ETB's last
    days. WE should add by way of clarification that <q>Romps</q> was ETB's
    name for himself, and <q>Toby</q> was his name for his wife Jessie.
    \begin{quote}
    ``E.T. Bell, known as Pop Romps to me (he refused to be called Grandpa),
    brings back some interesting and humorous memories. You asked how he was
    as a grandfather. The answer is that he tolerated me and my two sisters
    reasonably well. He wasn't the type to sit his grandkids on his lap. I
    believe he was pretty fond of Laurie, the older of the two (both younger
    than me). From what I know, he always took more of a liking to females
    than males (that reminds me of the fact that he apparently did not want
    any children, his wife <q>tricked</q> him into it, and he was unhappy that
    he had a boy rather than a girl). We visited him in Pasadena maybe two
    or three times that I can remember. I remember a modest home with walls
    full of books and lots of cigar smoke. He had quite a large garden and a
    really neat study in a small structure in the middle of the garden. He
    visited us in Watsonville a few times when he was healthy. I remember
    one time when I felt I really hadn't spent any time with him, and asked
    to stay home from school for the day. We sat in the living room
    together, no doubt awkwardly for him. I don't remember anything about
    the visit except that I was just learning to multiply at the time, and
    he asked me to figure out what 7 x 7 is. It took me a while to get 49,
    and to this day those are my favorite numbers
  </p>

  <p>
    Some time in late 1958 or early 1959 he was still living in Pasadena
    when he fell off a chair he was standing on to change a light bulb and
    broke his arm. My parents (both physicians) decided to bring him up to
    the Watsonville Hospital where they could keep an eye on him while he
    recovered. Then they decided he wasn't fit to live by himself and that
    he should live in a rest home in Watsonville. When they announced their
    plans, he made is abundantly clear that he had no intention of living
    with a bunch of old farts. He would stay right where he was, end of
    discussion! He was moved to a private room close to the nurses' station.
    He flirted with the nurses, smoked cigars, filled his room with books,
    worked on The Last Problem, and drank Scotch. He was quite popular with
    the nurses. On one occasion he caught his bed on fire as a result of
    careless smoking. He was reprimanded by the hospital administration and
    told he could not smoke without a nurse being present. He said, ``Great,
    I will enjoy more company!'' and continued to smoke when he wanted to
  </p>

  <p>
    I was in the sixth grade when he passed away. As I was getting on my
    bicycle to ride to school, my Mom came out to tell me that Pop Romps had
    died the night before. She told me to go to school. That evening I
    remember having a short, awkward conversation with my Dad and telling
    him I was sorry that Pop Romps had died. There was NO other discussion
    or acknowledgement of his death within the family at the time. There was
    no way that my Dad would get involved in with kind of service because
    his religious upbringing was totally non-existent. When he was in the
    third grade, he asked his parents what the big plus sign on the building
    was for!

    When I was in college, it occurred to me that I never knew what happened
    after Pop Romps died. I asked my Mom, and she told me he was still in
    her closet. He had left very specific instructions that he was to be
    cremated and his ashes spread at the base of the rock on a hillside in
    Yreka, California, where he had proposed to his wife, Toby. He had
    spread her ashes there. He left directions and a photo of the location.
    Yreka is in the northernmost part of California. My parents did not have
    an occasion to go up there and didn't want to make a special trip, so he
    stayed in the closet. They made the trip in the early 1970's. They
    arrived early on a foggy morning and found the rock near a swing set in
    the back yard of a nice home. Dad hopped the fence and did the deed. The
    ashes were very light in color and contained bone fragments. They didn't
    exactly blend with the green grass, which was covered with dew. He tried
    to work them into the grass with his feet and just made matters worse.
    He got back in the car and drove out of town fast before somebody
    spotted the rather suspicious activity. Pop Romps was no doubt reveling
    through the whole ordeal.''

    FOUR (OR EIGHT) DISTRIBUTION PROBLEMS

    The formulas derived earlier for the number of <em>onto</em> functions f
    from a domain <m>\{ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{m}\}</m> to a codomain <m>\{ y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{n}\}</m> can be used as a model for the
    following distribution problem: in how many ways can you place n
    different objects into k different bins, not allowing empty bins? Some
    texts use the word distinguishable instead of different. We will also
    use the word similar to connote the same meaning as indistinguishable
  </p>

  <p>
    The concept of <em>compositions</em> of n into k parts likewise serves as
    a model for the following distribution problem: in how many ways can you
    place n similar objects into k different boxes either allowing empty
    boxes or not? As this second class of problem is a little easier let's
    analyze it first.

    \begin{result}The number of ways of placing n similar objects into k different
    bins not allowing empty bins is <m>\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}</m> . Denote the k different bins by <m>x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{k}</m> . The number of solutions to <m>x_{1} + x_{2} + \ldots + x_{k} = n</m> where each <m>x_{i} \geq 1</m> is
    the number of such distributions.
    \end{result}

    \begin{result}  The number of ways of placing n similar objects into k different
    bins allowing empty bins is <m>\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}</m> . The number of solutions to <m>x_{1} + x_{2} + \ldots + x_{k} = n</m> where each <m>x_{i} \geq 0</m> is
    the number of such distributions. Notice here that allowing, <m>x_{2}</m> ,
    for example, to be 0 is the same as saying that no objects will be
    placed in bin \#2.
    \end{result}

    Now let's turn to the first problem. Using the Principle of
    Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE) we see that the number of functions from \{1,
    2, 3, 4, 5\} <em>onto} \{a, b, c\} is <m>3^{5} - 3 \bullet 2^{5} + 3 \bullet 1^{5</em></m> . Similarly, the number of
    functions from \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} <em>onto} \{a, b, c, d\} is <m>4^{6} - 4 \bullet 3^{6} + 6 \bullet 2^{6} - 4 \bullet 1^{6</em> =
    \binom{4}{4}
    4^{6} -
    \binom{4}{3}
    3^{6} +
    \binom{4}{2}
    2^{6} -
    \binom{4}{1}
    1^{6}.</m> PIE can be used to show that, in general, the
    number of functions from <m>\{ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}\}</m> <em>onto} <m>\{ y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{k}\</em></m> is
    <md>
      \left( n,k \right) = k^{n} - \binom{k}{1} \left( k - 1 \right)^{n} + \binom{k}{2} \left( k - 2 \right)^{n} - \binom{k}{3} \left( k - 3 \right)^{n} + \ldots + \left( - 1 \right)^{k - 1}\binom{k}{k - 1} 1^{n}
    </md>
    Each onto functions characterizes a distribution problem as follows: the
    following onto function
    \begin{longtable}[]{@{}llllll@{}}
    \toprule
    x & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\tabularnewline
    \midrule
    \endhead
    f(x) & a & a & b & c & b\tabularnewline
    \bottomrule

    \end{longtable}

    can be considered as a model for distributing the two different objects
    1 and 2 into a bin <em>a</em> , the two different objects 3 and 5 into bin
    <em>b} and 4 into bin \emph{c</em> . Since each of the complete inverse
    images <m>f^{- 1}\left( a \right),f^{- 1}\left( b \right),</m> and <m>f^{- 1}(c)</m> is non-empty (the function being onto guarantees this)
    this model counts distributions that do not allow empty bins. This
    establishes the following distribution result.

    \begin{result}
	 The number of ways of placing <em>n</em> different objects into
    <em>k</em> different bins with no empty bins is <m>B(n,k)</m> .
    \end{result}
    \begin{result}
	 The number of ways of placing n different objects into k
    different bins in <m>k^{n}.</m> \end{result}
    Without the restriction of <q>no empty bins</q> this is just a matter of
    saying that there are k places for disposing of each of the n objects.
    This is also the number of functions from <m>\{ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}\}</m> <em>to} <m>\{ y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{k}\</em></m> , ignoring the restriction that
    they must be onto
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, we look at what happens if the n objects are different but the
    k bins are now similar, still with no empty bins allowed. Since there
    are k! ways to label the k bins, there are k! ways to convert similar
    bins into different bins. The number of distributions of this type is
    therefore <m>\frac{1}{k!}B(n,k)</m> . For convenience of notation, let's
    call this last expression: <m>S\left( n,k \right).</m> \begin{result}
	 The number of ways of placing n different objects into k similar
    bins with no empty bins is <m>S\left( n,k \right).</m> \end{result}

    There is one additional distribution problem that we can analyze using
    the machinery developed thus far. In how many ways can you place n
    different objects into k similar bins <em>allowing</em> empty bins. Using
    the sum rule we can look at the following disjoint cases:

    No box is empty- <m>S(n,k)</m> Exactly one box is empty- <m>S(n,k - 1)</m> \begin{quote}
    Exactly two bins are empty- <m>S(n,k - 2)</m> \end{quote} <m>\vdots</m> All but one bin are empty- <m>S(n,1)</m> \begin{result} The number of ways of distributing n different objects into k or
    fewer bins is <m>S\left( n,1 \right) + S\left( n,2 \right) + \ldots + S(n,k)</m> .
    \end{result}

    Finally, the theory of linear or integer <em>partitions</em> solves the
    final distribution problem: In how many ways can you distribute n
    similar objects into k similar bins? Recall that a <em>partition} <m>\left( a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{k</em> \right)</m> of an integer n is an
    array of integers <m>a_{i}</m> such that <m>n = a_{1} + a_{2} + \ldots + a_{n}</m> and <m>a_{1} \geq a_{2} \geq a_{3} \geq \ldots \geq a_{k} > 0</m> . For
    example, the 5 partitions of n=4 are 4, 31, 22, 211, 1111. Here, the
    distribution 31 is the same as 13 since the bins are similar.

  <title>COMBINATORIAL PROOFS</title>
  <p>
    A combinatorial proof is sometimes used to show that two very different
    looking expressions are in fact equal. The technique is as follows.
    Refer to the two different looking expressions as the left-hand side
    (LHS) and the right-hand side RHS. Create a situation or question that
    is answered by the LHS; then show that the RHS also answers the
    question. The conclusion is that LHS=RHS
  </p>

  <p>
    In the following we present a number of theorems, statements,
    identities, etc, and give combinatorial proofs of each. For each result
    the reader is urged to attempt an alternate proof for comparison
    purposes. Such an alternate proof could be algebraic or geometric in
    nature; or one could try a collapsing sum or an induction proof.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{2n}{2}
          = 2
          \binom{n}{2}
          + n^{2}</m> Split the <m>2n</m> objects into two groups A and B as shown:
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    \textbf{. . . . . . . . . . }

    A B

    First, you can choose 2 objects from a set of <m>2n</m> objects
    in <m>\binom{2n}{2}</m> ways. Alternatively, you could select two from group A
    in <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> ways or two from group B in <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> ways or take one from each in <m>n \bullet n = n^{2}</m> ways. Now add <m>\binom{n}{2}
    +
    \binom{n}{2}
    + n \bullet n</m> and the result follows. The reader should
    attempt an algebraic proof using the factorial formula
    for <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> .

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{m + n}{2}
          -
          \binom{m}{2}
          -
          \binom{n}{2}
          = mn</m> Suppose you have a group of m men and n women and you want to form
          men-women dancing pairs. This can clearly be done in mn ways. Or, you
          could choose 2 from the total of m + n and delete the men-men pairs
          (there are <m>\binom{m}{2}</m> of these) and delete the women-women pairs
          (also <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> of these). The result follows. The reader could attempt
          an algebraic proof or perhaps a geometric proof making use of figures
          consisting of triangular numbers. Also, as a challenge, the reader could
          formulate a similar result involving <m>\binom{a + b + c}{3}</m> and a corresponding proof.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{n}{0}
          +
          \binom{n}{1}
          +
          \binom{n}{2}
          + \ldots +
          \binom{n}{n}
          = 2^{n}</m> Here again we first create a question that is answered by either side of
          the given identity. Question: How many subsets does <m>\{ a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}\}</m> have? An n-set has <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> subsets. The left-hand side counts these subsets by
          their size. There are <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> subsets of size k.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    In this situation the reader might <em>not</em> want to try this
    algebraically.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{n}{1}
          + 2
          \binom{n}{2}
          + 3
          \binom{n}{3}
          + \ldots + n
          \binom{n}{n}
          = {n2}^{n - 1}</m> Given a set of n people we can select a committee of size k along with a
          chair from that committee in <m>k
          \binom{n}{k}</m> ways. We can select a committee (of size 1, or size 2,
          or \ldots{}) and its chair in <m>\binom{n}{1}
          + 2
          \binom{n}{2}
          + 3
          \binom{n}{3}
          + \ldots + n
          \binom{n}{n}</m> ways. Alternatively, we can explain the term <m>n2^{n - 1}</m> as follows: choose one of the n people to chair any of
          the <m>2^{n - 1}</m> subsets of the remaining <m>n - 1</m> people.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    The reader is invited to investigate one or more of the following
    approaches: <m>n2^{n - 1}</m> looks like a derivative, so try
    differentiating <m>\left( 1 + x \right)^{n}</m> ; a reverse and add approach
    also works; or, first prove <m>k
    \binom{n}{k}
    = n
    \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}</m> and then use it.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{n}{k}
          =
          \binom{n - 1}{k}
          +
          \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}</m> <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> is the number of subsets of <m>\{ a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots,a_{n}\}</m> of size k. Now a subset A
          of size k either contains the fixed element <m>a_{i}</m> or it does not.
          If A contains <m>a_{i}</m> , the remaining <m>k - 1</m> elements can be
          selected in <m>\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}</m> ways. If, on the other hand, A does not contain <m>a_{i}</m> , you can choose the k elements from the depressed set <m>\left\{ a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{i - 1,}a_{i + 1,\ldots,}a_{n} \right\}</m> in <m>\binom{n - 1}{k}</m> ways. Since these two cases are mutually exclusive the
          theorem follows.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    Once again the reader is invited to attempt an algebraic proof.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>d_{n}</m> denote the number of derangements of 1,
          2, 3, \ldots{}, n with <m>d_{0} = 1,d_{1} = 0.</m> Then <m>d_{n} = \left( n - 1 \right)(d_{n - 1}{+ d}_{n - 2})</m> for <m>n \geq 2</m> .
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    In forming a derangement of 1, 2, 3, \ldots{}, n the integer n can be
    placed in any of the <m>n - 1</m> spots 1, 2, 3, \ldots{}, <m>n - 1</m> , say
    spot i. If i goes into spot n there are <m>d_{n - 2}</m> ways to finish it.
    If i does not go into spot n there are <m>d_{n - 1}</m> ways to complete
    the derangement
  </p>

  <p>
    The reader can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to derive a
    formula for <m>d_{n}</m> from which the new recursion <m>d_{n} = nd_{n - 1} + \left( - 1 \right)^{n}</m> , and the above
    recursion, can be derived.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{n}{0}
          ^{2} +
          \binom{n}{1}
          ^{2} +
          \binom{n}{2}
          ^{2} + \ldots +
          \binom{n}{n}
          ^{2} =
          \binom{2n}{n}</m> Given a group of <m>2n</m> people consisting of n men and n women, in how
          many ways can one choose a group of n people? The answer to that
          question is just <m>\binom{2n}{n}</m> , the right side of the identity in question. One could
          also form the group of n people in the following way: choose 0 men and n
          women in <m>\binom{n}{0}
          \binom{n}{n}
          =
          \binom{n}{0}
          ^{2}</m> ways, or, choose 1 man and <m>n - 1</m> women in <m>\binom{n}{1}
          \binom{n}{n - 1}
          =
          \binom{n}{1}
          ^{2}</m> ways, or choose 2 men and <m>n - 2</m> women in <m>\binom{n}{2}
          \binom{n}{n - 2}
          =
          \binom{n}{2}
          ^{2}</m> ways and so on. Now add these disjoint cases.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    An alternate algebraic proof is less interesting: Extract the
    coefficient of <m>x^{n}</m> from both sides
    of. <m>\left\lbrack \left( x + 1 \right)^{n} \right\rbrack^{2} = \left( x + 1 \right)^{2n}</m>

    <theorem>

        <p>
          <m>\binom{2}{2}
          +
          \binom{3}{2}
          +
          \binom{4}{2}
          + \ldots +
          \binom{n}{2}
          =
          \binom{n + 1}{3}</m> The term <m>\binom{n + 1}{3}</m> is the number of binary strings of length <m>n + 1</m> consisting of three 1's (and the rest 0's). The left hand side counts
          these by where in the string the left- most 1 appears. Let <m>a_{1}a_{2}a_{3}\ldots a_{n + 1}</m> be a string of length <m>n + 1</m> .
          There are <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> strings when <m>a_{1} = 1,\binom{n - 1}{2}</m> strings when <m>a_{2} = 1</m> is the leftmost 1, \ldots{},
          and <m>\binom{2}{2}</m> strings when <m>a_{n - 1} = 1</m> is the leftmost 1. In
          this last case the string looks like 000 \ldots{} 0111.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    Attempting a proof by mathematical induction is an easy option. An
    algebraic approach is not!

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The number of positive integers that have their digits
          in strictly increasing order is <m>2^{9} - 1</m> . Include single digit
          numbers.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    There are <m>\binom{9}{1}</m> single digit type, <m>\binom{9}{2}</m> double digit type (just select 2 of the 9 digits 1, 2,
    3, \ldots{}, 9 and arrange in order), \ldots{}, and so on to see that
    there are <m>\binom{9}{9}</m> nine digit type. The total is <m>\binom{9}{1}
    +
    \binom{9}{2}
    +
    \binom{9}{3}
    + \ldots +
    \binom{9}{9}
    = 2^{9} - 1.</m> Here is an alternative, more clever, proof. Look at 123456789. Any
    increasing number can be made by deleting <em>any</em> subset of digits,
    except all of them. There are <m>2^{9} - 1</m> such subsets. For example,
    delete the subset \{2, 4, 7, 9\} and you get 13568. Combining these two
    approaches actually gives you a nice proof that <m>\binom{9}{0}
    +
    \binom{9}{1}
    +
    \binom{9}{2}
    + \ldots +
    \binom{9}{9}
    = 2^{9}</m> .

          - 6n

          want to select triples consisting of one man, one woman and one child.
          There are <m>n^{3}</m> ways to do this, just pick one from each group.
          Alternatively, select 3 of the 3n people in <m>\binom{3n}{3}</m> ways and delete the <q>bad</q> ones. Delete the ones where
          you selected all three from one group -- there are <m>3
          \binom{n}{3}</m> of these. Now delete those where you had two from one
          group and one from another -- there are <m>2n

          ^{2} =
          \binom{2n}{n}</m> Let's revisit this identity using equivalence relations. A binary
          relation R on the set of all binary strings of length n is defined by
          specifying that <m>\left( \alpha,\beta \right) \in R</m> whenever weight <m>\alpha =</m> weight <m>\beta</m> . This R is an equivalence relation. For
          n=3 there are four different equivalence classes, each containing
          strings of weight 0, 1, 2, or 3. The relation R contains <m>1^{2} + 3^{2} + 3^{2} + 1^{2}</m> ordered pairs; for example, with
          weight 1 each of the three strings 001, 010, 100 can be paired with any
          one of those same strings for a total of <m>3^{2} = 9</m> . These ordered
          pairs can be counted in another way. Each ordered pair looks like <m>\left( - - - ,- - - \right).</m> Place 1's in any three positions,
          and 0's in the others. If you take the complement of the entries in the
          second coordinate an element of R is produced. Here is what one sequence
          of this process looks like: <m>\left( - - - , - - - \right) \rightarrow \left( - 11,- - 1 \right) \rightarrow \left( 011,001 \right) \rightarrow (011,110)</m> .
          The reader can check that this process always produces an element of R
          and that the case of n=3 extends easily to general n. Conclusion: choose
          the n positions for 1's in <m>\binom{2n}{n}</m> ways. The result follows.

    Here is a question that might resolve the issue. How many different
    brick paths of length n (and width 1) can you make using 1 x 1 bricks
    and 1 x 2 bricks? Let a(n) denote the number of such paths of length n.
    A few drawings will show that a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=3, a(4)=5. Since you
    can place a 1 x 1 brick in front of all paths of length <m>n - 1</m> or a 1
    x 2 brick in front of all paths of length <m>n - 2</m> we have that <m>a\left( n \right) = a\left( n - 1 \right) + a\left( n - 2 \right)</m> .
    This recursion, along with the initial conditions, show that <m>a\left( n \right) = F_{n + 1}</m> , the left-hand side of the identity
  </p>

  <p>
    Now lets look at all paths of length n and count them by the number of 1
    x 2 bricks. If there are i 1 x 2 bricks there are <m>n - i</m> total bricks
    making up the path of length n. Choose the positions of the i 1 x 2
    bricks in <m>\binom{n - i}{i}</m> ways. Now sum as i ranges through the values

    0, 1, 2, \ldots{}, and obtain <m>\binom{n}{0}

    \binom{n - 1}{1}
    +
    \binom{n - 2}{2}
    + \ldots = F_{n + 1}</m>

    The reader should draw all paths of length <m>n = 5</m> , for example, and
    examine the cases with i=0, 1, 2 . The reader could also explore other
    proofs.

    There are mn one by one squares in the subdivided

    m by n rectangle. Each choice of arrows

    (one horizontal, one vertical) specifies one of these squares

  be accomplished? Among the m people there are <m>\binom{m}{2}</m> handshakes; among the n people there are <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> handshakes and between the two groups, mn. But, <m>\binom{m + n}{2}</m> also represents the total number of handshakes among the

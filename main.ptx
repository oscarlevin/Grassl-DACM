  <title>COMBINATORIAL PROOFS</title>
  <p>
    A combinatorial proof is sometimes used to show that two very different
    looking expressions are in fact equal. The technique is as follows.
    Refer to the two different looking expressions as the left-hand side
    (LHS) and the right-hand side RHS. Create a situation or question that
    is answered by the LHS; then show that the RHS also answers the
    question. The conclusion is that LHS=RHS
  </p>

  <p>
    In the following we present a number of theorems, statements,
    identities, etc, and give combinatorial proofs of each. For each result
    the reader is urged to attempt an alternate proof for comparison
    purposes. Such an alternate proof could be algebraic or geometric in
    nature; or one could try a collapsing sum or an induction proof.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{2n}{2}
          = 2
          \binom{n}{2}
          + n^{2}</m> Split the <m>2n</m> objects into two groups A and B as shown:
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    \textbf{. . . . . . . . . . }

    A B

    First, you can choose 2 objects from a set of <m>2n</m> objects
    in <m>\binom{2n}{2}</m> ways. Alternatively, you could select two from group A
    in <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> ways or two from group B in <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> ways or take one from each in <m>n \bullet n = n^{2}</m> ways. Now add <m>\binom{n}{2}
    +
    \binom{n}{2}
    + n \bullet n</m> and the result follows. The reader should
    attempt an algebraic proof using the factorial formula
    for <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> .

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{m + n}{2}
          -
          \binom{m}{2}
          -
          \binom{n}{2}
          = mn</m> Suppose you have a group of m men and n women and you want to form
          men-women dancing pairs. This can clearly be done in mn ways. Or, you
          could choose 2 from the total of m + n and delete the men-men pairs
          (there are <m>\binom{m}{2}</m> of these) and delete the women-women pairs
          (also <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> of these). The result follows. The reader could attempt
          an algebraic proof or perhaps a geometric proof making use of figures
          consisting of triangular numbers. Also, as a challenge, the reader could
          formulate a similar result involving <m>\binom{a + b + c}{3}</m> and a corresponding proof.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{n}{0}
          +
          \binom{n}{1}
          +
          \binom{n}{2}
          + \ldots +
          \binom{n}{n}
          = 2^{n}</m> Here again we first create a question that is answered by either side of
          the given identity. Question: How many subsets does <m>\{ a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}\}</m> have? An n-set has <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> subsets. The left-hand side counts these subsets by
          their size. There are <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> subsets of size k.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    In this situation the reader might <em>not</em> want to try this
    algebraically.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{n}{1}
          + 2
          \binom{n}{2}
          + 3
          \binom{n}{3}
          + \ldots + n
          \binom{n}{n}
          = {n2}^{n - 1}</m> Given a set of n people we can select a committee of size k along with a
          chair from that committee in <m>k
          \binom{n}{k}</m> ways. We can select a committee (of size 1, or size 2,
          or \ldots) and its chair in <m>\binom{n}{1}
          + 2
          \binom{n}{2}
          + 3
          \binom{n}{3}
          + \ldots + n
          \binom{n}{n}</m> ways. Alternatively, we can explain the term <m>n2^{n - 1}</m> as follows: choose one of the n people to chair any of
          the <m>2^{n - 1}</m> subsets of the remaining <m>n - 1</m> people.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    The reader is invited to investigate one or more of the following
    approaches: <m>n2^{n - 1}</m> looks like a derivative, so try
    differentiating <m>\left( 1 + x \right)^{n}</m> ; a reverse and add approach
    also works; or, first prove <m>k
    \binom{n}{k}
    = n
    \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}</m> and then use it.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{n}{k}
          =
          \binom{n - 1}{k}
          +
          \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}</m> <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> is the number of subsets of <m>\{ a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots,a_{n}\}</m> of size k. Now a subset A
          of size k either contains the fixed element <m>a_{i}</m> or it does not.
          If A contains <m>a_{i}</m> , the remaining <m>k - 1</m> elements can be
          selected in <m>\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}</m> ways. If, on the other hand, A does not contain <m>a_{i}</m> , you can choose the k elements from the depressed set <m>\left\{ a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{i - 1,}a_{i + 1,\ldots,}a_{n} \right\}</m> in <m>\binom{n - 1}{k}</m> ways. Since these two cases are mutually exclusive the
          theorem follows.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    Once again the reader is invited to attempt an algebraic proof.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>d_{n}</m> denote the number of derangements of 1,
          2, 3, \ldots, n with <m>d_{0} = 1,d_{1} = 0.</m> Then <m>d_{n} = \left( n - 1 \right)(d_{n - 1}{+ d}_{n - 2})</m> for <m>n \geq 2</m> .
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    In forming a derangement of 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n the integer n can be
    placed in any of the <m>n - 1</m> spots 1, 2, 3, \ldots, <m>n - 1</m> , say
    spot i. If i goes into spot n there are <m>d_{n - 2}</m> ways to finish it.
    If i does not go into spot n there are <m>d_{n - 1}</m> ways to complete
    the derangement
  </p>

  <p>
    The reader can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to derive a
    formula for <m>d_{n}</m> from which the new recursion <m>d_{n} = nd_{n - 1} + \left( - 1 \right)^{n}</m> , and the above
    recursion, can be derived.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{n}{0}
          ^{2} +
          \binom{n}{1}
          ^{2} +
          \binom{n}{2}
          ^{2} + \ldots +
          \binom{n}{n}
          ^{2} =
          \binom{2n}{n}</m> Given a group of <m>2n</m> people consisting of n men and n women, in how
          many ways can one choose a group of n people? The answer to that
          question is just <m>\binom{2n}{n}</m> , the right side of the identity in question. One could
          also form the group of n people in the following way: choose 0 men and n
          women in <m>\binom{n}{0}
          \binom{n}{n}
          =
          \binom{n}{0}
          ^{2}</m> ways, or, choose 1 man and <m>n - 1</m> women in <m>\binom{n}{1}
          \binom{n}{n - 1}
          =
          \binom{n}{1}
          ^{2}</m> ways, or choose 2 men and <m>n - 2</m> women in <m>\binom{n}{2}
          \binom{n}{n - 2}
          =
          \binom{n}{2}
          ^{2}</m> ways and so on. Now add these disjoint cases.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    An alternate algebraic proof is less interesting: Extract the
    coefficient of <m>x^{n}</m> from both sides
    of. <m>\left\lbrack \left( x + 1 \right)^{n} \right\rbrack^{2} = \left( x + 1 \right)^{2n}</m>

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{2}{2}
          +
          \binom{3}{2}
          +
          \binom{4}{2}
          + \ldots +
          \binom{n}{2}
          =
          \binom{n + 1}{3}</m> The term <m>\binom{n + 1}{3}</m> is the number of binary strings of length <m>n + 1</m> consisting of three 1's (and the rest 0's). The left hand side counts
          these by where in the string the left- most 1 appears. Let <m>a_{1}a_{2}a_{3}\ldots a_{n + 1}</m> be a string of length <m>n + 1</m> .
          There are <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> strings when <m>a_{1} = 1,\binom{n - 1}{2}</m> strings when <m>a_{2} = 1</m> is the leftmost 1, \ldots,
          and <m>\binom{2}{2}</m> strings when <m>a_{n - 1} = 1</m> is the leftmost 1. In
          this last case the string looks like 000 \ldots 0111.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    Attempting a proof by mathematical induction is an easy option. An
    algebraic approach is not!

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The number of positive integers that have their digits
          in strictly increasing order is <m>2^{9} - 1</m> . Include single digit
          numbers.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    There are <m>\binom{9}{1}</m> single digit type, <m>\binom{9}{2}</m> double digit type (just select 2 of the 9 digits 1, 2,
    3, \ldots, 9 and arrange in order), \ldots, and so on to see that
    there are <m>\binom{9}{9}</m> nine digit type. The total is <m>\binom{9}{1}
    +
    \binom{9}{2}
    +
    \binom{9}{3}
    + \ldots +
    \binom{9}{9}
    = 2^{9} - 1.</m> Here is an alternative, more clever, proof. Look at 123456789. Any
    increasing number can be made by deleting <em>any</em> subset of digits,
    except all of them. There are <m>2^{9} - 1</m> such subsets. For example,
    delete the subset \{2, 4, 7, 9\} and you get 13568. Combining these two
    approaches actually gives you a nice proof that <m>\binom{9}{0}
    +
    \binom{9}{1}
    +
    \binom{9}{2}
    + \ldots +
    \binom{9}{9}
    = 2^{9}</m> .

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{3n}{3}
          = 3
          \binom{n}{3}
          + 6n
          \binom{n}{2}
          + n^{3}</m> This one is a little tougher. First rewrite as <m>n^{3} =
          \binom{3n}{3}
          - 3
          \binom{n}{3}
          - 6n
          \binom{n}{2}</m> . Suppose you have n men, n women and n children and you
          want to select triples consisting of one man, one woman and one child.
          There are <m>n^{3}</m> ways to do this, just pick one from each group.
          Alternatively, select 3 of the 3n people in <m>\binom{3n}{3}</m> ways and delete the <q>bad</q> ones. Delete the ones where
          you selected all three from one group -- there are <m>3
          \binom{n}{3}</m> of these. Now delete those where you had two from one
          group and one from another -- there are <m>2n
          \binom{n}{2}
          + 2n
          \binom{n}{2}
          + 2n
          \binom{n}{2}</m> of these.

        <p>
          <m>1 \bullet 1! + 2 \bullet 2! + 3 \bullet 3! + \ldots + n \bullet n! = \left( n + 1 \right)! - 1</m> In how many ways can you arrange the n+1 numbers 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n so
          that they are <em>not} in ascending order? The answer is <m>\left( n + 1 \right)! - 1</m> since 0, 1, 2, \ldots{</em>, n is the
          <em>only</em> arrangement in ascending order. Now lets separate into
          cases. Let <m>a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}</m> represent an
          arrangement of these n+1 numbers. If <m>a_{0} \neq 0</m> , there are n
          choices left for <m>a_{0}</m> , and then n! ways to fill out <m>a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}</m> for a total of <m>n \bullet n!</m> . Now
          let <m>a_{0} = 0</m> but <m>a_{1} \neq 1</m> . There are <m>n - 1</m> choices for <m>a_{1}</m> and <m>\left( n - 1 \right)!</m> ways to complete for a total of <m>\left( n - 1 \right)\left( n - 1 \right)!</m> . Now continue with <m>a_{0} = 1,a_{1} = 1</m> but <m>a_{2} \neq 2</m> . There are <m>\left( n - 2 \right)\left( n - 2 \right)!</m> ways, and so on.

    The reader should attempt a collapsing sum or induction proof.

        <p>
          <m>1 \bullet n + 2\left( n - 1 \right) + 3\left( n - 2 \right) + \ldots + n \bullet 1 =

          of S of size 3 is <m>\binom{n + 2}{3}</m> . Each one looks like \{a, b, c\} with a \textless{} b
          \textless{} c, Let's count these by looking at the size of the middle
          element b. If b=1 , there is one choice for a, namely a=0 and n choices
          for c for a total of <m>1 \bullet n</m> . If b=2 there are 2 choices for a,
          and <m>n - 1</m> choices for c for a total of <m>2(n - 1)</m> . If b=3 the
          total is <m>3(n - 2)</m> , and so on. The total derived by looking at cases is <m>1 \bullet n + 2\left( n - 1 \right) + 3\left( n - 2 \right) + \ldots + n \bullet 1</m> and this must equal <m>\binom{n + 2}{3}</m> since the cases are disjoint.

          of k people with one of those k people to serve as chair. Choose the
          subcommittee in <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> ways and the chair in k ways. The product rule
          gives <m>\text{k}

    </theorem>

    Alternatively, you could first choose any one of the n people to serve
    as chair and then fill out the committee in <m>\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}</m> ways. There are <m>n
    \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}</m> ways to select a chaired subcommittee. Hence <m>k

    set of the first <m>2^{n}</m> nonnegative
    integers <m>0,1,2,\ldots,2^{n} - 1</m> . When you convert each to
    binary form what is the total number of 1s written? This binary list
    will look like the standard listing in <m>B^{n}</m> the set of all binary
    strings of length n. For n=3 <m>B^{3} = \{ 000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111\}</m> . In <m>B^{n}</m> each string has length n and there are <m>2^{n}</m> of them. But
    half of the <m>n \bullet 2^{n}</m> symbols are 1's. Then the total number
    of 1's is <m>n2^{n - 1}</m> . Alternatively, we could consider each string
    and count those with one 1, then those with two 1's, etc. There are <m>1 \bullet
    \binom{n}{1}</m> with one 1, <m>2
    \binom{n}{2}</m> total 1's in those binary numbers with exactly two 1's, <m>3

          \binom{n}{2}
          ^{2} + \ldots +
          \binom{n}{n}
          ^{2} =
          \binom{2n}{n}</m> Let's revisit this identity using equivalence relations. A binary
          relation R on the set of all binary strings of length n is defined by
          specifying that <m>\left( \alpha,\beta \right) \in R</m> whenever weight <m>\alpha =</m> weight <m>\beta</m> . This R is an equivalence relation. For
          n=3 there are four different equivalence classes, each containing
          strings of weight 0, 1, 2, or 3. The relation R contains <m>1^{2} + 3^{2} + 3^{2} + 1^{2}</m> ordered pairs; for example, with
          weight 1 each of the three strings 001, 010, 100 can be paired with any
          one of those same strings for a total of <m>3^{2} = 9</m> . These ordered
          pairs can be counted in another way. Each ordered pair looks like <m>\left( - - - ,- - - \right).</m> Place 1's in any three positions,
          and 0's in the others. If you take the complement of the entries in the
          second coordinate an element of R is produced. Here is what one sequence
          of this process looks like: <m>\left( - - - , - - - \right) \rightarrow \left( - 11,- - 1 \right) \rightarrow \left( 011,001 \right) \rightarrow (011,110)</m> .
          The reader can check that this process always produces an element of R
          and that the case of n=3 extends easily to general n. Conclusion: choose
          the n positions for 1's in <m>\binom{2n}{n}</m> ways. The result follows.

          So the left-hand side must provide the same enumeration. The left side
          partitions the permutations according to how many elements are deranged
          (and the rest fixed). The term <m>\binom{n}{i}
          d_{i} =
          \binom{n}{n - i}
          d_{\text{i}}</m> gives the number of permutations of n where <m>n - i</m> elements are fixed and the remaining i elements are deranged.

    Here is a question that might resolve the issue. How many different
    brick paths of length n (and width 1) can you make using 1 x 1 bricks
    and 1 x 2 bricks? Let a(n) denote the number of such paths of length n.
    A few drawings will show that a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=3, a(4)=5. Since you
    can place a 1 x 1 brick in front of all paths of length <m>n - 1</m> or a 1
    x 2 brick in front of all paths of length <m>n - 2</m> we have that <m>a\left( n \right) = a\left( n - 1 \right) + a\left( n - 2 \right)</m> .
    This recursion, along with the initial conditions, show that <m>a\left( n \right) = F_{n + 1}</m> , the left-hand side of the identity
  </p>

  <p>
    Now lets look at all paths of length n and count them by the number of 1
    x 2 bricks. If there are i 1 x 2 bricks there are <m>n - i</m> total bricks
    making up the path of length n. Choose the positions of the i 1 x 2
    bricks in <m>\binom{n - i}{i}</m> ways. Now sum as i ranges through the values

    0, 1, 2, \ldots, and obtain <m>\binom{n}{0}
    +
    \binom{n - 1}{1}
    +
    \binom{n - 2}{2}
    + \ldots = F_{n + 1}</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    The reader should draw all paths of length <m>n = 5</m> , for example, and
    examine the cases with i=0, 1, 2 . The reader could also explore other
    proofs.

    There are mn one by one squares in the subdivided

    m by n rectangle. Each choice of arrows

    (one horizontal, one vertical) specifies one of these squares
  </p>

  <p>
  Pick two arrows but don't take two from the top or two from

  the side. Then <m>\binom{m + n}{2}
  -
  \binom{m}{2}
  -
  \binom{n}{2}
  = mn</m> 3. Take m people in one group and n in another. How many handshakes can
  be accomplished? Among the m people there are <m>\binom{m}{2}</m> handshakes; among the n people there are <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> handshakes and between the two groups, mn. But, <m>\binom{m + n}{2}</m> also represents the total number of handshakes among the
  people. Then we get: <m>\binom{m}{2}
  +
  \binom{n}{2}
  + mn =
  \binom{m + n}{2}</m> .

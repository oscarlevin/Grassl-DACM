  <title>
  A BRIEF HISTORY OF FIBONACCI NUMBERS
</title>
<introduction>
<p>
  Fibonacci numbers receive their name from Leonardo of Pisa (Leonardo
  Pisano, c. 1175-1250), better known as Leonardo Fibonacci. Fibonacci is
  a contraction of Filius Bonacci, son of Bonacci
  </p>

  <p>
    Leonardo was born about 1175 in the commercial center of Pisa. This was
    a time of great interest and importance in the history of Western
    Civilization. One finds the influence of the crusades stirring and
    awakening the people of Europe by bringing them in contact with the more
    advanced intellect of the East. During this time the Universities of
    Naples, Padua, Paris, Oxford, and Cambridge were established, the Magna
    Carta signed in England, and the long struggle between the Papacy and
    the Empire was culminated. Commerce was flourishing in the Mediterranean
    world and adventurous travelers such as Marco Polo were penetrating far
    beyond the borders of the known world
  </p>

  <p>
    It is in this growing commercial activity that we find the young
    Leonardo at Bugia on the Northern coast of Africa. Here the merchants of
    Pisa and other commercial cities of Italy had large warehouses for the
    storage of their goods. Actually very little is known about the life of
    this great mathematician. No contemporary historian makes mention of
    him, and one must look to his writings to find information about him
  </p>

  <p>
    A mathematician before his time, Leonardo of Pisa, alias Leonardo
    Pisano, alias Leonardo Bigollo, alias Fibonacci, was a despair to his
    teacher as a young boy and an enigma to his colleagues in his later
    years. Convinced of the superiority of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system
    over the Roman system, Leonardo wrote one of his greatest works,
    <em>Liber Abaci</em> (in English, <q>Book of Calculating</q>) to introduce
    this system to the Western world. The <em>Liber Abaci</em> was written in
    1202 but was not published until 1857 because <q>it was too advanced for
    Leonardo's contemporaries.</q> Along with the introduction and development
    of many mathematical topics, the <em>Liber Abaci</em> contained
    interesting story problems that Leonardo liked to invent. His most
    popular problem is the breeding pair of rabbits: <q>How many pairs of
    rabbits will there be after a year if it is assumed that every month
    each pair produces one new pair, which begins to bear young two months
    after its own birth?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    This problem generates the infinite sequence that bears his name because
    his work is the earliest known recording. The Fibonacci sequence begins
    with 1 and each number that follows is the sum of the previous two
    numbers. The first ten Fibonnaci numbers are: <m>1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,
    34, 55</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Leonardo, in 1228, gave a second edition of the <em>Liber Abaci</em> which
    he dedicated to Michel Scott, astrologer to the Emperor Frederic II and
    author of many scientific works. Copies of this edition exist today.
    Leonardo profusely illustrated and strongly advocated the Hindu-Arabic
    system in this work. He gave an extensive discussion of the Rule of
    False Position and the Rule of Three. Leonardo did not use a general
    method in problem solving; each problem was solved independently of the
    others. In the solution of a problem he not only considered the problem
    as it might occur, but considered all of the variations of the question,
    even those that were not reasonable
  </p>

  <p>
    Because of Leonardo's great reputation, the emperor Frederick II, when
    in Pisa (1225), held a sort of mathematical tournament to test
    Leonardo's skill. The competitors were informed beforehand of the
    questions to be asked, some or all of which were composed by Johannes of
    Palermo, who was of Frederick's staff. This is the first case in the
    history of mathematics that one meets with an instance of these
    challenges to solve particular problems which were so common in the
    sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
  </p>

  <p>
    The first question propounded was to find a number of which the square
    when decreased or increased by 5 would remain a square. The correct
    answer given by Leonardo was 41/12. The next question was to find by the
    methods used in the tenth book of Euclid a line whose length x should
    satisfy the equation <m>x^3 + 2x^2 + 10x - 20 = 0</m> . Leonardo showed by
    geometry that the problem was impossible, but he gave an approximation
    of the root <m>1.3688081075\ldots</m>, which is correct to nine places.
    <em>Liber Abaci</em> contains many additional problems of this type
  </p>

  <p>
    After the <q>Rabbit Problem,</q> the matter lay for 400 years. In 1611,
    Johann Kepler, of astronomy fame, arrived at the series <m>1, 1, 2, 3, 5,
    8, 13, 21, \ldots</m> . There is no indication that he had access to one
    of Fibonacci's hand-written books (the <em>Liber Abaci</em> was not
    published until 1857).
  </p>
  <p>
    Simon Stevens (1548-1620) wrote on the famous Golden Section.  The editor of his works, A. Gerarad, arrived at the following formula for expressing the series in 1634:
    <me>
      F_{n + 2} = F_{n + 1} + F_{n}.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    A hundred years must pass before the problem is again considered. In
    1753, R. Simpson derived a formula, implied by Kepler:
    <me>
      F_{n - 1}F_{n + 1} - F_{n}^{2} = \left( - 1 \right)^{n}.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    A second hundred years pass by and the series again comes under study.
    In 1843, J.P.M. Binet derives an analytical function for determining the
    value of any Fibonacci number:
    <me> 2^n \sqrt{5} F^n = (1 + \sqrt{5})^{n} - (1 - \sqrt{5})^{n}.</me>

    In 1846 E. Catalan derived the formula:
    <me>
      2^{n - 1}F_{n} = \frac{n}{1} + \frac{5n\left( n - 1 \right)\left( n - 2 \right)}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3} + \frac{5^{2}n\left( n - 1 \right)\left( n - 2 \right)\left( n - 3 \right)\left( n - 4 \right)}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5}.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    By now, the series had received enough attention to deserve a name. It
    was variously called the Braun series, the Schimper-Braun series, the
    Lam√© series and the Gerhardt series. A. Braun, applied the series to the
    arrangement of the scales of pine cones. Schimper is completely unknown.
    Gerhardt is probably a misspelling of Girard
  </p>

  <p>
    Edouard Lucas, who dominated the field of recursive series during the
    period 1876-1891, first applied Fibonacci's name to the series and it
    has been known as the Fibonacci series since then
  </p>

  <p>
    About this time, 1858, Sam Loyd claimed to have invented the
    checkerboard paradox. It is first found in print in a German journal in
    1868. Today it seems proper to call it the Carroll Paradox after Lewis
    Carroll (Charles Dodgson, 1832-1893) who was quite fond of it.
